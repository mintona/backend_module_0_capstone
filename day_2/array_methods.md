# Array Methods

1. `.sort` will return a new array where elements are sorted. Strings will return in alphabetical order and numbers will return ascending numerical order.

1. `.last` will pull the last element in an array. While `.first` will pull the first element in an array.

1. `.each` will iterate through each element of an array.

1. `.join` will mash together arrays, meaning it will take the data in the array and return it as a string.

1. `.index` will find the address of a specific element in the array.

1. `.include?` will ask if an element is present in the array.

1. `[]` will fetch a certain elements in an array. We can do it with a single number or a range of numbers. We can also use negative numbers to start at the end of any array.

1. `.collect` returns a new array with the values asked for.

1. `.shuffle` returns a new array with the contents of the original shuffled randomly.
